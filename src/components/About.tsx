              Hello! My name is Saurabh, and I enjoy bringing ideas to life on the web. 
              What started as a curiosity for how things work behind the scenes grew into 
              a passion for building full-stack applications that solve real-world problems.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Currently, I work as an SDE-1 at a fast-paced startup, building SaaS products 
              across domains like healthcare and e-commerce. I enjoy working across the stack 
              â€“ from frontend development and backend services to databases and cloud deployment.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              I focus on writing clean, scalable code and delivering user-centric products 
              that are both functional and reliable.
            </p>
            
            <p>Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:</p>
            
            <ul className="skills-list">
              <li>Java 24</li>

              <li>JavaScript (ES6+)</li>
              <li>TypeScript</li>
              <li>React</li>
              <li>Mysql and MongoDB</li>
            </ul>
